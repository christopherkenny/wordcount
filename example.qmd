## Heading

Words can be inserted by using the `{{wordcount}}` doohickey.
It's not a shortcode, since those have inner arrows.
It is something, maybe a placeholder.

There are {{wordcount}} words.^[Works with general footnotes too: total of {{wordcount}} words.]

We can add cites too, such as @knuth1984.
Then we can count the total words, including references, as {{wordcountref}} using `{{wordcountref}}`.

## Words by section

The number of words by section will be logged to the Quarto terminal.

### Lower-level headings

Of course, low level headings can be used too.

### Behavior of Inline Code

There are two YAML parameters that control how code is counted:

- **`count-code-blocks`** – includes or excludes fenced/indented code blocks (`CodeBlock` elements).
- **`count-inline-code`** – includes or excludes inline code spans (`` `like this` ``).

Both default to `true` for backward compatibility.  
When `count-inline-code` is enabled, inline code counts each non-space token inside backticks.  
For example, `` `r 2+2` `` adds **2** words, while `` `r 2 + 2` `` adds **4**.  
Setting `count-inline-code: false` prevents inline code from affecting the total word count.
