## Heading

Words can be inserted by using the `{{wordcount}}` doohickey.
It's not a shortcode, since those have inner arrows.
It is something, maybe a placeholder.

There are {{wordcount}} words.

We can add cites too, such as @knuth1984.
Then we can count the total words, including references, as {{wordcountref}} using `{{wordcountref}}`.

## Words by section

The number of words by section will be logged to the Quarto terminal.

### Lower-level headings

Of course, low level headings can be used too.

## References
